Festival Fanatic is a Ruby on Rails web application that helps its users manage their
film-festival attendance.

The production version is {here}[http://festivalfanatic.com]; right now, that's the old
Rails 2.3.9-based version. This version is a complete rewrite based on Rails 3.2.9 (and
will be upgraded to Rails 4 as it, and the other gems it depends on, stabilize).
