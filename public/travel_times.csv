Festival Fanatic Travel Times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This table shows the travel times in each direction between venues; some of the venues aren't used this year but I kept them for testing with last year's data; ignore them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Read down the left column to find the starting theater, then across to the destination theater's column.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In filling out this table, I assumed that people would walk between downtown venues and drive between downtown and the outlying venues. (Cinema 21 is outlying.) The parking time is added already if necessary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If you'd like to suggest changes, please edit ONLY THE NUMBERS and mail it back (as an email attachment) to festfan@festivalfanatic.com",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
