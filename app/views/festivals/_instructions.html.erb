  Your festival schedule is below;

  click a screening to see more information about the film,

  add the screening to your schedule (we'll automatically unselect
  conflicting screenings and other screenings of that film),

  see more information about the film and its other screenings,

  change your priority for this film or rate it once you've seen it,

  or (shortly!) read buzz about the film & add your own. Also:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    You can always go back to the "Your Film Priorities" tab to adjust
    your priorities, then use the "Scheduling Assistant" to re-schedule
    the rest of the festival for you.

      You'll shortly be able to download a printable PDF of your schedule;
      this feature isn't quite ready yet. You'll also be able to download
      your schedule in iCalendar or Google Calendar formats (and if anyone
      sends me Feedback asking for My Yahoo! calendar format, I'll do that
      too).
    </li>
    <li>
      You'll also be able to share your schedule and a list of your film
      ratings with your friends using links that will appear <i>right here</i>
      as soon as those features are done; I'll work on them right after the
      printable PDF feature.
