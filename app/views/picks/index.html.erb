<h3>Your film priorities</h3>

<% hidable_instructions do %>
  <p>
    The goal of this site is to help you see the films you really want to see -
    it's a three step process: you start by prioritizing the festival's films,
    then you tell me which screenings you can see, then I build a schedule that
    (hopefully!) fits your priorities. If it's your first visit, go ahead and
    check out the other two tabs above, then come back to this first one - I'll
    wait!
  </p>

  <p>
    So, to get started, you'll indicate your preference for each film by
    clicking one of the little circles next to each film below.
    The highest priority means "<%= Pick::PRIORITY_HINTS[8] %>," and the lowest
    means "<%= Pick::PRIORITY_HINTS[0] %>;" if you've made a choice and want to
    remove it for some reason, clicking the
    "<%= image_tag('raty/cancel-off.png', height: 16, width: 16) %>"
    will forget you ever made a choice.
  </p>

  <p>
    If there's a film you've seen already, you can note what you thought of it
    here by entering a rating from one to five stars; you can also come back and
    enter ratings later.
    <% if current_user_is_ffff? %>
      <i>Ah, I see you're an FFFF member! I'll share your ratings with Doug.
        <% if allow_ffff_download? %>
          Oh, it's you, Doug: <%= link_to("FFFF Ratings", festival_path(@festival, format: :xlsx),
                                          class: 'btn btn-small') %>
        <% end %>
      </i>
    <% else %>
      (I'll be sharing these ratings &mdash; see
      <%= link_to 'the Help page', help_path %> for details.)
    <% end %>
  </p>

  <% if user_signed_in? %>
    <div>
      <span>
        Each choice is saved as soon as you click. When you're done, click the
        "Continue" button at the bottom to move to the next step. You can come
        back later if you don't finish now, or if you want to change a priority
        or add a rating; you can also reset all your priorities and ratings and
        start over by clicking this button:
        <%= button_to "Discard all priorities and ratings",
                      reset_rankings_festival_path(@festival),
                      :confirm => "Are you sure you want to throw away all your priorities and ratings?",
                      :class => "btn btn-small" %>
      </span>
    </div>

    <% unless Rails.env.production? %>
      <div>
        <span>
          <i>Ah, you're testing! Click this button to randomly assign priorities
          to <%= (Festival::RANDOM_ASSIGNMENT_PERCENTAGE * 100).to_i %>% of the films:</i>
          <%= button_to "Assign random priorities",
                        random_priorities_festival_path(@festival),
                        :class => "btn btn-small" %>
        </span>
      </div>
    <% end %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>

<% if sort_order_is_not_user_specific?(@sort_order) %>
  <% cache ['picks', @festival, @sort_order, @show_press] do %>
    <%= render partial: 'picks/films' %>
