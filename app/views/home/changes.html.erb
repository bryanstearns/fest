<h5>2/6/13 7:10pm</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Fix error when clicking on screenings of films without a country,
      like the shorts programs.</li>
  <li>Fix a problem where the highest priority choices didn't get saved;
      thanks Doug, Sandy, and others who reported this, but especially Laura
      who clued into the idea that it was only the highest-priority ones that
      went missing!</li>

    screenings" buttons</li>
